* Implement QuickCheck types for PinReadTrigger, SysfsEdge.

* Move SysfsException type to MonadSysfs.

* Create top-level Linux.hs module with tidy exports.

* Make types lens-ready.

* Check compatibility with debounce, timeout

* Investigate porting SysfsMock to CatchT and losing IO.

* See if I can re-jig MonadSysfs documentation so that it's only exported for the MonadSysfs.hs module.

* Review MonadSysfs instances.
Is ContT appropriate? ExceptT? They're definitely not for SysfsIOT due
to its MonadThrow constraint, but they might be OK for SysfsMock.

* Get rid of errors package dependence.

* Clean up .cabal, esp. extensions section.

* Add a MonadSysfs example?

* Release 0.6.0.
Put it on Hackage? RFC on Reddit?

* Implement FreeBSD GPIO (using ioctls?).
